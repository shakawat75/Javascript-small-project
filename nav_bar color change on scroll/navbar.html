		<p>Educational Pathways in FinTech
FinTech Boot Camps
FinTech boot camps provide a space for students to get started quickly in fintech. Boot camps provide structured learning opportunities and hands-on experience for students interested in the field. Boot camps are both personalized and intensive â€” they offer thorough curricula simulating real-world experiences but they often can be pursued remotely, in a schedule-friendly manner. Columbia Engineering FinTech Boot Camp, for example, offers a base for anyone wanting to get started in fintech within just 24 weeks, including flexible modules covering everything from financial analysis to algorithmic trading and blockchain transactions.

Degrees With a Focus on FinTech
When it comes to traditional degrees, more colleges are offering degrees with a focus on fintech as the field grows. These programs allow students to learn the specifics of a traditional finance major while developing the technical skills that may be potentially valuable in fintech. These programs typically take 2-4 years to complete, depending on the degree program and how many classes a student can take at once.

Self-Taught FinTech Options
There are also many resources available for those wanting to learn fintech on their own, including free online courses, educational multimedia and apps, and digital guides. Self-teaching options are ideal for those favoring a fully autonomous learning structure, offering the chance to learn industry basics along with personal organization and time management skills.</p>
